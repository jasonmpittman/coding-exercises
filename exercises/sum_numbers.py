""" Sum Numbers:
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
    (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
    (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
    (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
    (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
    (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
    (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
