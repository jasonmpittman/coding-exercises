""" Max Divisors:
Find the integer from a to b (included) with the greatest number of divisors. For example:

divNum(15, 30)   ==> 24
divNum(1, 2)     ==> 2
divNum(0, 0)     ==> 0
divNum(52, 156)  ==> 120

If there are several numbers that have the same (maximum) number of divisors, the smallest among them should be returned. Return the string "Error" if a > b.
