""" Prison Break:
A prison can be represented as a list of cells. Each cell contains exactly one prisoner. A 1 represents an unlocked cell and a 0 represents a locked cell.

[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Starting inside the leftmost cell, you are tasked with seeing how many prisoners you can set free, with a catch. You are the prisoner in the first cell. If the first cell is locked, you cannot free anyone. Each time you free a prisoner, the locked cells become unlocked, and the unlocked cells become locked again.

Example:
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    # You free the prisoner in the 1st cell.

    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1] 
    # You free the prisoner in the 3rd cell (2nd one locked).

    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    # You free the prisoner in the 6th cell (3rd, 4th and 5th locked).

    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
    # You free the prisoner in the 7th cell - and you are done!
