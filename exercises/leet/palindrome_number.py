"""
Given an integer x, return true if x is a, and false otherwise. 

Examples:
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
