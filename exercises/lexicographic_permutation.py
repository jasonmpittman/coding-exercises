""" Lexicographic Permutation:

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For exmaple, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1,2,3, and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1, and 2 are:

012, 021, 102, 120, 201, 210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9?
