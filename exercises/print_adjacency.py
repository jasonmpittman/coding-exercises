""" Print Adjacency: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-adjacency-list-for-a-directed-graph/

Given the adjacency list and number of vertices and edges of a graph, the task is to represent the adjacency list for a directed graph.

Example:
    Input: V = 3, edges[][]= {{0, 1}, {1, 2} {2, 0}}
    Output:     0 -> 1
                1 -> 2
                2 -> 0
