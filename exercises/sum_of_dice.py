""" Sum of Dice:
You have n dices each one having s sides numbered from 1 to s. How many outcomes add up to a specified number k?

For example if we roll four normal six-sided dices we have four outcomes that add up to 5.

(1, 1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 2, 1) (1, 2, 1, 1) (2, 1, 1, 1)

There are 100 random tests with:

    0 <= n <= 10
    0 <= s <= 20
    0 <= k <= n * s
