""" Billboard:
A billboard is an m * n array, where each array element consists of either one letter or a blank space. You are given a phrase and the billboard dimensions. Create a function that determines whether you can place the complete phrase on the billboard.

There are two rules:

    If there is a space between two words:
        If they are on the same row, you must put a space.
        If they are two different rows, the space is optional.
    You can only put COMPLETE words on a row.
