""" Bulls and Cows:

Create a four digit random number from the digits 1 to 9, without duplication.

The program should:

1. ask for guesses to this number
2. reject guesses that are malformed
3. print the score for the guess

The score is computed as:

    The player wins if the guess is the same as the randomly chosen number, and the program ends.
    A score of one bull is accumulated for each digit in the guess that equals the corresponding digit in the randomly chosen initial number.
    A score of one cow is accumulated for each digit in the guess that also appears in the randomly chosen number, but in the wrong position.
