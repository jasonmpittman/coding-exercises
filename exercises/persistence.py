""" Persistence:
The additive persistence of an integer, n, is the number of times you have to replace n with the sum of its digits until n becomes a single digit integer.

The multiplicative persistence of an integer, n, is the number of times you have to replace n with the product of its digits until n becomes a single digit integer.

Create two functions that take an integer as an argument and:

    Return its additive persistence.
    Return its multiplicative persistence.
