""" Reach and Sum:
Make a function that receives three arguments in this order:

    init_val (initVal) is the starting number;
    pattern_l (patternL) is the list of repeating differences;
    nth_term (nthTerm) is the ordinal position of the term in the sequence (≤ 1,500,000).

The function should return the sum of the digits of the nth_term in the sequence.
Example Cases:

sum_dig_nth_term(10, [2, 1, 3], 6) → 10  
# 6th term = 19 → sum of digits = 1 + 9 = 10  

sum_dig_nth_term(10, [1, 2, 3], 15) → 10  
# 15th term = 37 → sum of digits = 3 + 7 = 10
