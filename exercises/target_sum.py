""" Target Sum:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

Examples:
    twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]
    twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) // returns [1, 2] or [2, 1]
