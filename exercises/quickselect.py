""" Quickselect:
Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the k'th smallest element in an unordered list. It is closely related to the Quicksort sorting algorithm. Like Quicksort, it is efficient traditionally and offers good average-case performance, but has a poor worst-case performance.


For example,
Input: [7, 4, 6, 3, 9, 1]
k = 2  
Output: kth smallest array element is 3    

Input: [7, 4, 6, 3, 9, 1] 
k = 1  
Output: kth smallest array element is 1
